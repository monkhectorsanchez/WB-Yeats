He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven
W.B. Yeats (1865-1939)

Had I the heavens' embroided cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

(Anthony Hopkins recited the poem in the movie '84 Charing Cross Road')
